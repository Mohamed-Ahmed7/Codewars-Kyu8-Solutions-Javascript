//? How good are you really?

// Description:
// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!

// But you're an ambitious person.
//  You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores.
//  Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return true if you're better, else false!

// Note:
// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points.
//  Do not forget them when calculating the average score!

function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  let averageScore = classPoints.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur);
  return averageScore / classPoints.length <= yourPoints
}
console.log(betterThanAverage([100, 40, 34, 57, 29, 72, 57, 88],0)); // True
