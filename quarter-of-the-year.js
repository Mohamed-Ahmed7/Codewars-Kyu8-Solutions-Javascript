// Quarter of the year

// Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

// For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

// Constraint:

// 1 <= month <= 12

const quarterOf = (month) => {
  return Math.ceil(month / 3) ;
};

console.log(quarterOf(11));
console.log(quarterOf(3));
console.log(quarterOf(8));
console.log(quarterOf(5));
console.log(quarterOf(9));
